# Impossible Innovations :: Known Issues

* The exhaust of the all RCS are completely messed up.
	+ It will be tacked down on the next minor release 
* As from 0.8.9.0 , all the TweakScale support was rewritten from scratch.
	+ A few parts may be scaled wrongly on current crafts and savegames as a lot of errors were fixed. Sorry for that, but sooner or later this had to be done.
	+ The included reference crafts are already fixed.
* Impossible Innovations needs Module Manager 4.0.2 or newer, as it needs KSPe 2.2 that in turn needs some features only available from 4.0.2 and up.
	+ Be sure to have the latest Module Manager for your instalment.
