# Impossible Innovations

![](./PR_material/banner.jpg)

This mod adds some late-game engines and tanks to the game. These parts are fusion-based or use advanced technologies.

Now under New Management by Lisias. :)

## Description

This add in is useful for providing some functions that make interacting with the KSP API functionally nicer and with an improved interface. 

### Configuration

On the folder `<KSP_ROOT>/PluginData/ImpossibleInnovations` you will find a file called `user.cfg` where you can turn off the specialized II Category Filter on the VAB/SPH Advanced Menu. Set it to "NONE" or "CLASSIC" to deactivate or to activate the option.

This feature is useful if you want to use [Community Category Filter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149840-discussion-community-category-kit/), as it will declutter the Advanced Menu.


### Sample Crafts

* ![](./PR_material/crafts/II-R.jpg)
	+ Impossible Innovations/R
	+ Pretty standard multistage rocket:
		- Maximum Thrust / Engage SAS
		- Hit Stage to engage Deuterium Engines
		- Hit Stage to engage boosters and release clamps
		- Incline her to 5Â° as soon as she lift off - to prevent the boosters from falling over KSC.
* ![](./PR_material/crafts/II-A_front.jpg)
	+ Impossible Innovations/A
	+ An Aeris 3A modified to use Ionized Wings and Deuterium rocket engine.
		- Engage the Tritium Fuel Cells before taking off, or the wings will not work properly!  

And more on [KerbalX](https://kerbalx.com/hangars/44338) (soon also on Steam Workshop).


## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are now on its own file (see the [In a Hurry](#in-a-hurry) section) and on the distribution file.
